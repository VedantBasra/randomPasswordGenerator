Hi, 
I created tihs random password generator as a practice project. This is made using lists, loops and the random library. 
There are three settings to choose from, easy, medium strong. You also need to givve the length of the password. 
It is very easy to use and I have added several comments through out the code to make it readable.

I plan on improving it in the near future with a GUI and possible with a password manager.
